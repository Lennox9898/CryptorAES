# CryptorAES

- For coding beginners , students or as a target to crack AES . 
- Do whatever you want with it.
- Simple pythonscript using AES-128 gcm to show, how a file gets encrypted with a key .

## easy handling: text will go in input , keygen writes a 16B key to key.bin --> depending wether you click on decrypt.py or encrypt.py the text will go into same .txt   
Decrypt .py file will always use key.bin value.

if you want the .exe , just use pyinstaller
